## Usage

### Running

I've only tested running this library within other projects. Sym-link to this project
from the checkouts directory of the project. (See the
[Leiningen notes](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
for a discussion of this feature).  If you are me, a working example is at
~/Documents/git/projects/receipts/client/checkouts.

### Testing

`lein doo phantom test auto`
